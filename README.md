# Intrusion_Detection_System
An intruder is just like a person who trying to gain an unauthorized access to a System or Network with criminal intension. The purpose of intruders is to enter network or system & steal or corrupt the entire data. After that imbalanced the network environment. The problems came for identifying unknown and obfuscated malicious attack.
An Intrusion detection system(IDS) is a device or software application that monitors a network for Malicious activity or violation. IDS monitors network traffic and monitors for suspicious activity like any type of policy violation and alerts the system or network administrator. IDS is a system designed to test/analyze network system traffic/events against a given set of parameters and alert/capture data when these thresholds are met. IDS must operate without unduly affecting the system’s activity. IDS can’t prevent intruders, it is at least try to detect and prevent from similar attack happened in future.
